## Overview

This package provides implementation of a new method of rhythm detection, a suite of graphing functions for visualizing your discrete time signals, and a networker module to directly get pathway analysis via Gene Ontology or DAVID (I will add more in the future on a request basis) and visualize those pathways.

RPx is geared towards bioinformatics researchers, however it can also be applied to other fields that use discrete time signals. Testing for this package has been down with 12-point signals (I will use different size ones in the future).

## Survey of features

Some of the more prominent features of this package include the following:

* Detection of multiple periods at a time
* Classification of rhythmics over time -- i.e. RNA expression in young for gene x compared to RNA expression in old for gene x
* Different options for multiple test corrections
* Visualations suite for visualing entire dataset or single signal
* Built-in pathway analysis
* Network visualization for pathways
